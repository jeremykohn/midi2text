Programs for conversion standard midifiles from and to text format.

mf2t is a program that reads a standard midifile (format 0 or 1) and writes an ASCII representation of it that is both compact and easily parsable.

t2mf is the companion program that reparses the text representation into a midifile.

The text representation is chosen such that it is easily recognized and manipulated by programs like sed, awk or perl. Yet it is also humanly readable so that it can be manipulated with an ordianary text editor.

Both programs are described in detail [here](https://code.google.com/p/midi2text/wiki/ProgDescription) and generated text format [here](https://code.google.com/p/midi2text/wiki/TextFormatDescr).
